# Rick and Morty Character Explorer

## Overview

- **Back Navigation**: The profile page includes a "Back" button that allows users to return to the Home page.

- **Pagination**: The main table supports pagination, allowing users to navigate through different pages of characters.
  
- **Search Functionality**: An input field on the Home page enables users to search for characters by name, dynamically filtering the displayed characters based on the search term.
